    "In October 2019, teams from Google and Facebook published new transformer papers:  [T5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683) and [BART](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461). Both papers achieved better downstream performance on generation tasks, like translation and summarization, with two changes:\n",
    "- replace BERT's bidirectional encoder architecture with an encoder-decoder architecture\n",
    "- replace BERT's fill-in-the blank cloze task with a more complicated mix of pretraining tasks.\n",
    "\n",

    "In code, the idea of \"what information you can use when predicting the token at position `i`\" is controlled by an argument called `attention_mask`[^2]. A value of 1 in these examples means that the model can use information for the column's when predicting the row's word.\n",
